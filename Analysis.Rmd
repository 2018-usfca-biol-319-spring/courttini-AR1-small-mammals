# Introduction

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is an ecological observation facility that collects data on rapidly changing ecological processes in the United States. NEON has standardized data from 81 field sites that span across the United States within 20 eco-climatic domains that represent regions of distinct land forms, vegetation, climate, and ecosystem dynamics. NEON measures the causes and effects of environmental change in different types of environments and data sets. 

The different types of field sites include core terrestrial sites, core aquatic sites, relocatable terrestrial sites, and relocatable aquatic sites. The different sites ensure that the data will statistically represent ecological, physical, and biological differences spanning the continent. As seen from the image below, the field sites are also in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This image shows where the NEON sites are located including where the four different types of sites are located.

At the varying sites multiple different functional groups of dry mass are recorded depending the location of the site. This includes dry mass of flowers, leaves, mixed, needles, other, seeds, twigs/branches, and woody material. This project however, focusses on the small mammal box trapping data set, which assess abundance and diversity in North America. This data is the "mark-recapture, demographic, and size data collected by box trapping for small mammals" (i.e., rodents < 600 grams). NEON chose to observe these small mammals as they are common to almost every place and they are receptive to changes in the environment. These small mammals are based on a couple different characteristics including taxonomic, behavior, dietary, and size. This dataset recorded for each mammal captured the species identification, size, including length and weight, reproductive capabilities, and other small things in order to identify the species including, blood, ear, hair, whiskers, and fecal samples. This data is important for in the use of public health issues like disease prevalence, accounting for the amount of species that are in certain environments, and specifically for climate changes and land use.

The small mammal data that I will be focusing on for this analysis are the sites that contain both deciduous forest and evergreen forest. Specifically, I will be focusing on the sites Bartlett Experimental Forest (BART), Harvard Forest (HARV), Jones Ecological Research Center (JERC), Oak Ridge (ORNL), and Talladega National Forest (TALL). I also chose to look at the difference in sex and weight of the small mammals, between the two forests at each of the five NEON sites. My hypotheses are the abundance and size of the small mammals will be larger in the evergreen forests than in the decidous forests. I am also currious to find out which of the five NEON sites contains more small mammals and their differences in abundances between the two forests at each site. These proposed explanations were made based on the conclusions supplied by other research articles. 

Forests supply a habitat and home for many different speices including plants and animals. There is a difference between the different types of forests and ecpecially the ones looked at in the dataset being analyzed: evergreen and decidous forests. Evergreen trees/plants do not shed their leaves, while deciduous trees/plants lose their leaves in autumn. This is usually during the winter and dry season. One of the most distinguishing characteristics that is measured is leaf mass per area (LMA). "In deciduous forests, there is similarity between plastic and evolution- ary responses of LMA to light gradients. In evergreens, however, LMA is lower in shaded than sunlit individuals of the same species, whereas shade-tolerant evergreens have higher LMA than light-demanders grown under the same conditions" [lusk2008evergreen]. This shows the different demands that are brought about in these two different environments of forests. Therefore, the animals at these sites have to have a variations in their diets, which contributes to their weight. 

Many factors contribute to the abundance of small mammals in forests. One study looked at small mammal abundance in a managed forest. Some of the NEON sites are also managed. This study looked at an industrial forest in New Brunswick with the small mammals of voles, shrews and mice. They wanted to conclude whether or not small mammal abundance was affiliated with landscape context. This study proved that most species abundance correlate with vegetation, and landscape mangament was not [bowman2001landscape]. This helps us unnderstand that there should not be a difference in the abundance of mammals between the NEON sites that have managed forests and those that do not. The only thing that should affect their abundance and ultimately weight is their availability for resources. 

The fragmentation of these forests not only affects these animals abundances, but their diversity as well. According to a research article looking at a forest role in maintaing small mammal abundance and diversity in an atlantic forest landscape, the loss of habitat results in a less abundant small animal communities [@pardini2005role]. This shows that evergreen forests may contain more animals in that the leaves stay on their trees all year around. 

Understanding this data is important because it can be used by scientists, researchers, professors, and students to gain knowledge about ecological differences between different environments on recent ongoing data collection.

Delete this placeholder text, and replace it with your introduction text. You should include background on the NEON project including proper citations (e.g. [@thorpe2016introduction]), the sets of sites you are comparing, and other relevent background information related to your specific hypotheses. 

# Methods

This data came from the NEON database for the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) for small mammal sampling. The traps are placed at all terrestrail sites, except for Hawaii. These small mammals were captured using Sherman live traps about (3" x 3.75" x 9-12") in size and Tomahawk traps. One hundred of the Sherman traps are laid out within 10 m of spacing, in 10 rows and 10 columns making it 100 traps per grid. There is a total of up to 8 grids set for each sampling period. These traps are set with bait containing a seed mixture of 35% sunflowerseeds and 65% millet. For two other sites, traps with "bait balls" were set containg oatmeal, peanut butter, and vanilla extract. When captured, the small mammals were processed in the field in order for them to released quickly and to obtain the necessary data being collected.

The sites I will be focusing on are the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BART), Harvard Forest (HARV), Jones Ecological Research Center (JERC), Oak Ridge (ORNL), and Talladega National Forest (TALL). These are the five sites I chose to analyze because they are the only sites that contained two types of forests, evergreen and decidous forests. BART is a relocatable terrestrial site in New Hampshire that is primarily deciduous and 30% of the site is managed. HARV is a core terrestrial site in Massachusetts that represents many habitats including northern, transition, and central forests; marshes, swamps, conifers, and forest plantations. JERC is a relocatable terrestrial site in Georgia with Lower Coastal Plains and Flatwoods. ORNL is a core terrestrial site in Tennessee within the Appalachians and Cumberland Plateau. TALL is also a core terrestrial site in Alabama that consists of the Talladega National Forest. It is mostly Gulf Coastal Plain and appalachian foothills. I will be analzing these sites by compairing the sex and weight differences between the evergreen and deciduous forests located at each site.

# Discussion

Discuss the results you found in the context of what you know about the site/sites and the predominant types of vegatation in those locations. Think also about the community dynamics of the mammal community at each of the sites, in the context of what you know about different types of species interactions, food webs, trophic transfer, etc.

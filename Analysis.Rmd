# Introduction

Delete this placeholder text, and replace it with your introduction text. You should include background on the NEON project including proper citations (e.g. [@thorpe2016introduction]), the sets of sites you are comparing, and other relevent background information related to your specific hypotheses. 

# Methods

Describe where the data came from, including how they were collected in the field (information is in the pdf file in the data folder), some information about those sites and why you chose them, and how you are analyzing them (e.g. using R to visualize the results and the statistical tests you will use).

# Results

```{r load in needed packages}
#load packages needed for any analysis 
library("knitr")
library("dplyr")
library("readr")
library("ggplot2")
```

```{r load-in-dataset}
small_mammal_data <- readr::read_csv("data/raw_data/mam_pertrapnight.csv")
```

Add a number of code chunks in the Results section. These should read in, subset and plot the data as needed (no need to save any figures to pdf, since they will be put into the rendered document when you click 'knit'), and, for any hypotheses that you want to test, an appropriate statistical test. You should have at least 5 figures and/or tables in this section, which you use to test your hypotheses against the dataset.

# Discussion

Discuss the results you found in the context of what you know about the site/sites and the predominant types of vegatation in those locations. Think also about the community dynamics of the mammal community at each of the sites, in the context of what you know about different types of species interactions, food webs, trophic transfer, etc.
